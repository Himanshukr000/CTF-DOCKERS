        <p>Welcome to Shopiflag, the best place on the internet to buy or sell flags of all kind!</p>
        <p>
            At Shopiflag, we absolutely love flags. We think they are the best thing on Earth
            and we WILL shame you if you disagree. Here is a quote from wikipedia about flags, because
            we didn't have enough money nor time to pay someone to write something longer:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            A flag is a piece of fabric (most often rectangular or quadrilateral) with a distinctive design
            that is used as a symbol, as a signaling device, or as decoration. The term flag is also used to
            refer to the graphic design employed, and flags have since evolved into a general tool for rudimentary
            signalling and identification, especially in environments where communication is similarly challenging
            (such as the maritime environment where semaphore is used). National flags are patriotic symbols with
            varied wide-ranging interpretations, often including strong military associations due to their original
            and ongoing military uses. Flags are also used in messaging, advertising, or for other decorative
            purposes. The study of flags is known as vexillology, from the Latin word vexillum, meaning flag or
            banner.
            </br></br>
            Due to the use of flags by military units, 'flag' is also used as the name of some military units. A flag
            (Arabic: لواء) is equivalent to a brigade in Arab countries, and in Spain, a flag (Spanish: bandera) is a
            battalion-equivalent in the Spanish Legion.
