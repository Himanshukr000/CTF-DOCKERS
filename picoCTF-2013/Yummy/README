Simple problem to get people familiar with cookies and how to change them.
The Docking Bay Ship Status page has a hidden comment which tells the
users that the cookie is expected to be "authorization=administrator". If they
submit to the page with that cookie, they get the ships in the bay, as well
which ships are available for launch. The key is any docking bay ID which
has a ship with status "Awaiting Launch".
