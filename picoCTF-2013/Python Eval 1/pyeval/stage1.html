<h1>Exploiting sloppy use of <code>eval</code> in Python</h1>
<p>May popular scripting languages like Perl, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby have an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eval"><code>eval</code></a> function, which takes in code as a string and runs it (e.g. <code>x = eval("1 + x")</code> can increment <code>x</code>). While often very convenient, using <code>eval</code> can be  dangerous when someone with malicious intent can influence the string being passed to <code>eval</code>.</p>
<p>This challenge looks specifically at <code>eval</code> in Python. If you don't already know Python, you may wish to go over the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html">Python tutorial</a>. Even if you already do, you may at times wish to refer back to the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html">Python library reference</a>, because we'll be dealing with some features of Python that don't get used on a regular basis.</p>
<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p>Let's jump right in. Consider the following code that implements a simple guessing game:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="c"># example1.py</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">random</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">randint</span>
<span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">randint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;Guess the number! 1 to 100.&quot;</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="n">guess</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;Your guess&gt; &#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">guess</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">num</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;Nope,&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">guess</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;is wrong.&quot;</span>
  <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;You win!&quot;</span>
    <span class="nb">exit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>For the most part, this program works as expected (<code>$</code> represents a shell prompt):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>$ python example1.py
Guess the number! 1 to 100.
Your guess&gt; 42
Nope, 42 is wrong.
Your guess&gt; 99
Nope, 99 is wrong.
Your guess&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>In Python, <code>input(x)</code> is equivalent to <code>eval(raw_input(x))</code>: it takes user input, and evaluates it as a Python expression. This means that the program will happily accept any input that's a valid Python expression:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>$ python example1.py
Guess the number! 1 to 100.
Your guess&gt; 3*4
Nope, 12 is wrong.
Your guess&gt; &quot;hello&quot;
Nope, hello is wrong.
Your guess&gt; [1,2,3,4]
Nope, [1, 2, 3, 4] is wrong.
Your guess&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>But on input that's not a valid Python expression, <code>eval</code> will raise an exception.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>$ python example1.py
Guess the number! 1 to 100.
Your guess&gt; !@#$%^&amp;*()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;example1.py&quot;, line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
    guess = input(&#39;Your guess&gt; &#39;)
  File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 1
    !@#$%^&amp;*()
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
$ python example1.py
Guess the number! 1 to 100.
Your guess&gt; hello
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;example1.py&quot;, line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
    guess = input(&#39;Your guess&gt; &#39;)
  File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name &#39;hello&#39; is not defined
$
</pre></div>


<p>Notice that the exceptions above weren't the same. The first was a SyntaxError, which will be raised on any garbage string that isn't valid Python. The second was a NameError; this is because the string “<code>hello</code>” (without quotes) is a syntactically valid expression, which should evaluate to whatever value is stored in the variable <code>hello</code>. Of course, no such variable was ever defined in example1.py, so an exception is raised.</p>
<p>Now, if you've been thinking about it, you've probably guessed the punchline of this exercise already. At the time that <code>input()</code> is called in example1.py, the string “<code>num</code>” (without quotes) is a valid expression which of course evaluates to the value stored in the variable <code>num</code>. This makes it very easy to cheat the guessing game.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>$ python example1.py
Guess the number! 1 to 100.
Your guess&gt; num
You win!
$
</pre></div>


<p>What we've done here is exploited the fact that <code>eval()</code> gives us a <em>lot</em> of power, including the power to get to things that we weren't supposed to. Keep that in mind going forward: “getting to things that you aren't supposed to” is sort of a big deal for hackers.</p>
<h3>Task 1</h3>
<p>If you've been astutely following along, you now know enough to complete the first for-points task here. The following script is running on our servers. Your job is to get it to print out the secret <code>flag</code> (which has of course been redacted from the version below), and submit it back at the main picoCTF site. You can connect to the script by running <code>nc python.picoctf.com 6361</code> on a UNIX terminal. You can also download this script and run it on your own computer to figure out what do to.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="c"># task1.py</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;Welcome to mystery math!&quot;</span>

<span class="n">flag</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;xxxxxxxxxx&quot;</span>
