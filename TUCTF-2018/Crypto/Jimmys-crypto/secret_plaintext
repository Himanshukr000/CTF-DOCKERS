This is a secret file. Top secret. Don't steal my secrets. If you are looking at this file, look away now! You do not have the proper clearence to be viewing my secrets. This message will self-destruct in 3... 2... 1... Oh... you're still here. I thought that would scare you away. I fooled you though. My secrets aren't in this file. You'll have to find them somewhere else.
