# Binary Exploit Question 2
We were given a zip file which contained 3 java classes. I noticed one of them asked for a key [nq2eige2ig2323f.class](parallel/nq2eige2ig2323f.class)
I loaded the class files using [jd-gui](https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-gui/releases). I then looked at the above class and saw a pretty simple function the printed the flag based on a char array. So I copied and pasted the char array into python and then copied and pasted the flag print out function and ran the [script](solve.py)
