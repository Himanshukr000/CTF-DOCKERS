# Binary Exploitation Question 1

We are given the file [main.exe](main.exe).
First I ran the file command and saw this was a 64 ELF binary
After running strings on the program we see an interesting paragraph:
```
Cipher from Bill
Submit without any tags
#kdudpeh
```
I was pretty sure this was what I was looking for but just to be sure I looked at the program in radare and saw the program either printed "You Suck!" or it printed the interesting string.
Next I put the string in a caesar cipher solver [http://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher](http://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher) and found that the flag was probably harambe.
After attempting to submit the flag it did not work. So then I noticed a hint about sha1 so I calculate the sha1 of harambe and put that in as the flag and it was correct.
