**Description**: Hey! have you ever worked with NetBSD kernel modules?

**Flag**: flag{netB5D_i5_4ws0m3_y0u_sh0uld_7ry_i7}

**Walk through**: The player has to statically analyse the module to obtain the correct input "give_this_to_get_flag" which if passed to the module correctly will print the flag. The skeleton code for doing so is provided with the image, with detailed READMEs
