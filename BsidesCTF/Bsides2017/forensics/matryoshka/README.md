A compression format / archive format scavenger hunt.

This is likely going to be quite hard.  Solvers will have to examine a
lot of binary formats and try to infer the archiver used.  The 'file'
ulitily will help a lot but not all formats are covered by file.
There are 35 levels, each using a different format (though several
levels are different versions of the same underlying format like zip
vs zipx or rar vs rar5).
