This is simply dnscat2 traffic.

There are three sessions.

The first and third print a message encouraging the user.

The second is a command session that downloads /tmp/dnscap.png. That file is transferred via the connection, and is an image containing the key.

Due to re-transmits and stuff, this is actually going to be really tough.
