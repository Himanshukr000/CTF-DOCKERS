This level is simple: all you have to do is decrypt some HiddenCiphertext! To
make it even easier, I'll give you everything you need, except the ciphertext;
you have to find that on your own!

You will need:

* Algorithm: `AES-256-CBC`
* Key: `c086e08ad8ee0ebe7c2320099cfec9eea9a346a108570a4f6494cfe7c2a30ee1`
* IV: `0a0e176722a95a623f47fa17f02cc16a`

(Hint: As usual, the flag will start with 'FLAG:', so you'll know when you've
found it :) )
