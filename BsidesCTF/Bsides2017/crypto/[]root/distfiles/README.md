Our guy inside e-corp was able to get that packet capture of their
backend PKI you asked for.  Unfortunately it seems they're using TLS
to protect the modulus fetch.  Now, I have been told that the best
crackers in the world can do this in 60 minutes.  Unfortunately I need
someone who can do it in 60 seconds.
