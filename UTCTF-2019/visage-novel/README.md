## About This App
This application is a secured version of this boilerplate: https://github.com/paigen11/mysql-registration-passport

The goal is to leverage a SHA-1 length extension attack in order to perform a Cross-Site Scripting attack and gain admin privileges. 

If you plan to reuse this for a future CTF, make sure you change the MYSQL users and password, update the JWT secret, and change the SHA-1 salt.
