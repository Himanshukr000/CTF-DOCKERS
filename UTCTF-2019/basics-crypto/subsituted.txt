alright, you're almost there! Now for the final (and maybe the hardest...) part: a substitution cipher. In the following text, I've taken my message and replaced every alphabetic character with a correspondence to a different character - known as a substitution cipher. Can you find the final flag? hint: We know that the flag is going to be of the format utflag{...} - which means that if you see that pattern, you know what the correspondences for u, t, f, l a, and g are. You can probably work out the remaining characters by replacing them and inferring common words in the English language. Another great method is to use frequency analysis: we know that 'e' shows up most often in the alphabet, so that's probably the most common character in the text, followed by 't', and so on. Once you know a few characters, you can infer the rest of the words based on common words that show up in the English language.
