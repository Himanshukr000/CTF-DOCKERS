# InvalidFlags extends [HaliteAlert](HaliteAlert.md)

**Namespace**: `\ParagonIE\Halite\Alerts`

The flags passed to a constructor were wrong. If you are using the API as 
directed (i.e. not ever touching `Key` or `KeyPair` directly and instead using
one of their derived classes), you shouldn't ever encounter this Alert being
thrown.
