# Corporate Spying

Bad news, our concurrents 'WonderCorp' are better than us at making money !
Thankfully we've accidentally stumbled upon one of their marketing expert's
phone, a 'Wonder-GSM 3.4', and made a copy of the SMS database !

We've heard there were some very good ideas exchanged
during an SMS-brainstorming session on december 9th 2013, with the contact
+33647301695. These ideas could surely put us back on track !
But we don't understand the SMS database format,
can you find that information for us ?
