This is third part of h4x0rs.club challenge series.

With the original version, you have to achieve XSS then make admin send exploit payload into backend.

I release it again at 0ctf finals round since no one solved it, strip out the XSS part.

You can find solution inside [the slide](https://github.com/l4wio/CTF-challenges-by-me/blob/master/0ctf_final-2018/0ctf_tctf_2018_slides.pdf)

Binary and php's bridge can be downloaded in this folder.
