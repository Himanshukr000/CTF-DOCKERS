Add the challenge to the `config.yml` file:
```
challenges:
    # [required] An indiviual challenge config. The key is the challenge name
    # This should be a valid unix filename and preferably short
    listen:
        # [default: 1194] The exposed external port for this challenges OpenVPN server
        port: 2000
        # [required] The compose files to which define this challenge
        # Paths should be relative to the challenges directory
        files:
            - listen/docker-compose.yml
```
