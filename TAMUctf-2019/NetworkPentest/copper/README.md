# AES Malleability

## Challenge

This challenge involves having the player construct an encrypted telnet command that copies the flag file to a directory that can be seen.

## Setup
Place the entire `aes_ecb` folder into the challenges folder for Naumachia. Add the appropriate lines to the Naumachia config:
```
aes_ecb:
    # [default: 1194] The exposed external port for this challenges OpenVPN server
    port: 2000
    # [required] The compose files to which define this challenge
    # Paths should be relative to the challenges directory
    files:
        - aes_ecb/docker-compose.yml
        - common/docker-compose.yml
```

## Solution
The solution requires a few steps.

1. VPN into Naumachia environment
2. Start ettercap ettercap -G
3. Set to unified listen on tap0
4. Scan for hosts
5. Start wireshark
6. Start arp spoofing in sniff remote connections mode
7. Note the ip of "bob" and "alice"
8. Capture at least one full conversation
8. Stop arp spoofing
9. Construct the command `cp flag.txt /logs` from the encrypted bytes (PoC in `attacker/attacker.py`)
10. Send encrypted messages to telnet server
11. Grab the flag from `<ip>:8080/flag.txt`
