In a land far far away there was an old mother pig who had `three little pigs <https://americanliterature.com/childrens-stories/the-three-little-pigs>`_ and not enough cpu cores in her server to host them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.

The first little pig was very lazy and secured his server by not telling anyone about it. Honestly a wolf wouldn't need to huff and puff so much as sniff his way into the server.
