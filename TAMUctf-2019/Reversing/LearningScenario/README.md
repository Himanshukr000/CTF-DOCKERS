# Introduction to Reverse Engineering Challenge

### Reversing 1: You can solve this one with strings!

 For this problem, provide the Unix Executable and the ctf-er should be able to run strings and and get the flag (once they figure out the lines are base64 encoded)

### Reversing 2: gotta do a little more than just strings on this one (uncompyle6 or any python decompiler will do)

 For this problem, provide the .pyc problem which the ctf-er once decompiled will then have to figure out how the program works.. by you know.. reverse engineering to get the flag.

### Reversing 3: Cheers to exposure to basic assembly for future reverse engineering problems!

 This one is assembly where you can really read what's going. I put random stuff between halves of the printed out flags to make it a little harder to figure out but it's still pretty decipherable and will help beginners be less terrified of assembly.

### Reversing 4: Assembly Reverse Engineering Problem

Flag is not hardcoded and is full assembly with rot13 functions.
