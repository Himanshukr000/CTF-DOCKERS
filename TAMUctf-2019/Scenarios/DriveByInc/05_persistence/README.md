# 05_persistence

Thanks for finding that information out. We have since changed the password for that account. 
Looks like we might have to spend a few days putting our employees through some security training.
Unfortunately since deleting the malicous links off of our home page they have reappeared again.
Can you figure out how the attacker was able to re infect our home page?

## Questions
1. What is the md5sum of the file the attacker is using for persistence?
2. What account was created?
3. What group did the attacker add the account to?
4. What time of day does the attacker reinfect the machine? (use 24 hr notation ex: 0100 for 1 am)
