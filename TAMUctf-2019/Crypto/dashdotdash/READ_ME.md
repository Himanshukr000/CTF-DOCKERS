To 1337-H4X0R:

Our coworker Bob loves a good classical cipher. Unfortunately, he also loves to send everything encrypted with these ciphers. Can you go ahead and decrypt this for me?

—attached text file—

“

The initial text file is morse code that’s been written as its sounds, a combination of ‘di’, ‘dit’ and ‘dah’. They’ll need to convert it to ‘.’s and ‘-’s while keeping the spacing intact, then run it through a morse code decoder. What they’ll get back is a hex-encoded string. 

Unfortunately, morse code only works with capital letters so the hint is there to help some people recognize the encoding easier.(Could also be take it out to increase difficulty slightly) 

They’ll then run it through a hex decoder and they should get a string with the flag gigem{C1icK_cl1CK-y0u_h4v3_m4I1} in the middle of it.
