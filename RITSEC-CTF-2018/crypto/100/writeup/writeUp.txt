Challenge:  Lost In Transmission

Solution:

	Participants are given a string of Base64 encoded data. This data
	just so happens to be 1's and 0's, but take note that this is not
	binary. This is simply ASCII 1 and 0. Since this is not binary that
	further the challenge you must take some time and realize that this
	is a representation of morse code. The key is:

		1 = '.'
		0 = '-'

	Once you realize it is morse code, you can convert it to dots and dashes.
	When that is said and done it still won't convert!? That is because you
	will need to find the delimeter. There is a repeating sequence between
	all of the real morse code letters. This sequence is:

	DELIMETER = '.-.-.-'

	Once this is removed the morse code will convert normally giving you 
	the flag!

	FLAG: RITSEC{b33p_b00p_b00p_b33p}
