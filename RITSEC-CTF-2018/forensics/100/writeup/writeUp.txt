Challenge Name: Notes
Points:	100

Solution:

	The flag is hidden in an alternate data stream in the file "ctfNotes.txt".
	Refere to the "solution.png" image for the commands necessary to find the
	data stream, then access it. It would be helpful to read up on how NTFS
	allows you to do this for the challenge to make more sense. 

	In addition, the youtube video will link you to a rendition of
	"Row Row Row Your Boat" which should point you toward file streams
	because of the song.
