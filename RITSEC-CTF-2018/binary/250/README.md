## Deployment

- Files in the `dist` directory must be given to the user.
- To deploy the server, run `run.sh`. This will create a Docker image named pwn2 and run on port `1337` on the host machine. Modify the script as needed.

## Writeup

Writeup is provided in the `writeup` directory:

- Proof-of-Concept: `pwn2.py`
