<h1>RITSEC CTF 2018 Information</h1>

<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>
  Each team may have up to 5 team members. Teams comprised of 5 RIT students are
  eligible for prizes.
</p>

<p>
  Each team should create a single account in the CTF engine. This account should
  be shared among the team members.
</p>

<h2>Discord</h2>
<p>
  The CTF organizers and challenge authors will be online in our Discord server
  during the event. Check the CTF engine at ctf.ritsec.club for the join link to
  the Discord server.
</p>

<p>
  If you have questions about any of the challenges, hop into the relevant
  category channel on Discord to see if there are any hints/announcements about
  the challenge. If you still have a question, ask to talk to a challenge author
  and they will join DMs with you to discuss your question.
</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>
  Teams will be awarded points for challenges once they submit the proper flag
  for the challenge. Each challenge has a single flat point value. There will not
  be extra points for "first blood" or other early solves.
</p>

<p>
  If a team is able to prove they can solve the challenge, but there are
  technical difficulties that are preventing them from being awarded the points,
  a challenge author or CTF organizer may award the team the points for the
  challenge.
