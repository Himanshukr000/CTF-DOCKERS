# Hard To Get

### Description

I was playing with my brother's computer. I was the surfing the web for a while. Me being me, I clicked some random link that I found. It made me download a file. I don't know why I did that but sadly, the computer stopped responding. I called my brother and somehow we could get the memory dump of the system. Can you find out exactly what I downloaded and what the contents inside are?
