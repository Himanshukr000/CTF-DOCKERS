Fortunately, they decided to design their own block cipher. We have been able to recover a piece of source code they use to verify hardware implementations, and the location of a prototype embedded chip that will encrypt packets we send to it in ECB mode. We need you to recover the key they are using.\n\nSend data to the server over UDP in binary form. Every 8-byte block of the payload will be run through the block cipher and returned (max 1024 bytes). Please do not send too much traffic. We must be discreet.\n\nReport back with the key as a lower-case hexadecimal string.",
